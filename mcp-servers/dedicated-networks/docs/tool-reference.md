# Tool reference and workflow

Reference for the 18 tools of the CAMARA Dedicated Networks MCP server, how service areas are shown on a map, the
recommended order of calls, and the interactive map picker (currently disabled). The installation, configuration
and the list of tools are in the [README](../README.md).

## Tool reference

### Group 1: Networks

#### `camara_list_networks`

Lists all dedicated networks belonging to the caller.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | No | Exact network name to filter by. |
| `page` | integer | No | Read this one page. Omit it to get every item, from all pages. |
| `perPage` | integer (1-100) | No | Items per page; with `page`, that one page, without it the size of the pages read. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Returns**: Each network contains `id`, `status`, `serviceAreaId`, `serviceTime`, `networkProfileId` or `qosProfileName`, and `sink`.

---

#### `camara_get_network`

Fetches the current state of a single network by UUID.

---

#### `camara_create_network`

Creates a new dedicated network reservation. Starts in `REQUESTED` status.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | No | A human-readable name. Sent to the API; an API that does not accept it gets the request again without it, and the answer says so. |
| `serviceAreaId` | string (UUID) | Yes | Target geographic area (from `camara_retrieve_service_areas`). |
| `serviceTime` | `{ start, end }` | Yes | RFC 3339 timestamps with timezone offset. |

| `qosProfileName` | string | Exclusive* | QoS profile name; simplified, single-device option. |
| `sink` | string (HTTPS URL) | No | Webhook for status-change notifications. |
| `sinkCredential` | object | No | Auth credentials for the webhook. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

*Provide **exactly one** of `networkProfileId` or `qosProfileName`.

**Returns**: Created network object including its new `networkId`.

**Errors**: `400` Invalid input (bad timestamps, bad UUID, or both/neither profile fields provided).

---

#### `camara_delete_network`

Cancels a network reservation. Irreversible. Delete all device accesses first.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `networkId` | string (UUID) | Yes | ID of the network to cancel. |

**Errors**: `404` Network not found.

---

### Group 2: Profiles

Profiles are read-only resources managed by the CSP.

#### `camara_list_profiles`

Lists all network profiles available to the caller.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | No | Exact profile name to filter by. |
| `page` | integer | No | Read this one page. Omit it to get every item, from all pages. |
| `perPage` | integer (1-100) | No | Items per page; with `page`, that one page, without it the size of the pages read. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Returns**: Each profile contains `id`, `name`, `maxNumberOfDevices`, throughput budgets, `qosProfiles`, and `defaultQosProfile`.

---

#### `camara_get_profile`

Fetches full details of a single network profile by UUID.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `profileId` | string (UUID) | Yes | UUID of the profile. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Errors**: `404` Profile not found.

---

### Group 3: Accesses

An access grant ties a device to a network and controls which QoS profiles that device may use.

#### `camara_list_accesses`

Lists device access grants, optionally scoped to a specific network.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `networkId` | string (UUID) | No | Filter to a specific network. Omit to return all accesses. |
| `accessDeviceId` | string | No | Only accesses that contain this device (its access device id). |
| `name` | string | No | Exact access name to filter by. |
| `page` | integer | No | Read this one page. Omit it to get every item, from all pages. |
| `perPage` | integer (1-100) | No | Items per page; with `page`, that one page, without it the size of the pages read. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Returns**: Each access contains `id`, `networkId`, `stats` (devices in total, granted, denied), `defaultQosProfile`, `qosProfiles`, and `sink`; an API that still answers in the earlier form gives `status` and `device` on the access itself.

---

#### `camara_get_access`

Fetches the current state of a single access grant by UUID.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accessId` | string (UUID) | Yes | UUID of the access grant. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Returns**: Full access object including `statusInfo` (reason code if `REJECTED`).

**Errors**: `404` Access not found.

---

#### `camara_create_access`

Grants one or more devices access to a dedicated network. An access holds a list of devices: each is added with its own status, starting at `REQUESTED`. The answer lists the devices added (`addedAccessDevices`) with `stats`; if only some could be added, the failed ones are listed with the reason. An API that takes one device per access is sent that form, for exactly one device; for several devices the tool says so, and one access is created for each device instead.

**Token type determines how the device is identified:**

| Token type | `device` field |
|---|---|
| 2-legged | **Required**; provide `phoneNumber`, `ipv4Address`, or `ipv6Address`. |
| 3-legged | **Must be omitted**; device is derived from the token. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `networkId` | string (UUID) | Yes | Target network. |
| `name` | string | No | A human-readable name. Sent to the API; dropped, with a note in the answer, if the API does not accept it. |
| `device` | object | Conditional | One device (see above). |
| `devices` | list of objects | No | Several devices (1-100), each a device object. Use this or `device`, not both. |
| `qosProfiles` | list of strings | No | Allowed QoS profiles for this device. Omit to allow all. |
| `defaultQosProfile` | string | No | Default QoS profile for this device. |
| `sink` | string (HTTPS URL) | No | Webhook for status-change notifications. |
| `sinkCredential` | object | No | Auth credentials for the webhook. |

**Returns**: Created access object with its `accessId`.

**Errors**: `400` Invalid device identifier. `404` Network not found. `422` Device identifier rule violated.

---

#### `camara_delete_access`

Revokes a device's access grant. Irreversible.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accessId` | string (UUID) | Yes | UUID of the access grant to revoke. |

**Errors**: `404` Access not found.

---

#### Devices of an access

Six tools manage the devices of an existing access. An API that takes one device per access has no such endpoints and answers `404`; the tools then say so.

| Tool | What it does | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `camara_list_access_devices` | Lists the devices of an access, each with its `deviceId` (access device id), status and when it was added. | `accessId`; `deviceStatus` (`REQUESTED`, `GRANTED`, `DENIED`); `addedAtOrAfter`, `addedAfter`, `addedAtOrBefore`, `addedBefore` (RFC 3339); `page`; `perPage`; `response_format` |
| `camara_get_access_device` | Reads one device of an access. | `accessId`, `accessDeviceId`, `response_format` |
| `camara_add_device_to_access` | Adds one device. With a 2-legged token the `device` is required; with a 3-legged token it must be omitted. | `accessId`, `device` |
| `camara_add_devices_to_access` | Adds 1-100 devices. Lists the devices added and, for a partial success, each failed device with its reason. | `accessId`, `devices` |
| `camara_remove_devices_from_access` | Removes 1-100 devices by access device id. Lists any device that could not be removed. | `accessId`, `accessDeviceIds` |
| `camara_delete_access_device` | Removes one device. Irreversible. | `accessId`, `accessDeviceId` |

---

### Group 4: Service Areas

Service areas are read-only geographic regions defined by the CSP.

#### `camara_retrieve_service_areas`

Searches for service areas using geographic and/or profile filters. All filters are optional and AND-combined.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `atLocation` | `{ latitude, longitude }` | No | A point that must be covered by the area. |
| `overlappingArea` | `{ areaType: 'CIRCLE'\|'POLYGON', … }` | No | Shape that must overlap the area. |
| `coveringArea` | `{ areaType: 'CIRCLE'\|'POLYGON', … }` | No | Shape that the area must fully contain. |
| `byName` | string | No | Exact area name. |
| `byNetworkProfileId` | string (UUID) | No | Only areas supporting this network profile. |
| `byQosProfileName` | string | No | Only areas supporting this QoS profile name. |
| `page` | integer | No | Read this one page. Omit it to get every item, from all pages. |
| `perPage` | integer (1-100) | No | Items per page; with `page`, that one page, without it the size of the pages read. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Returns**: Each area contains `id`, `name`, `description`, `area` geometry, `networkProfiles`, and `qosProfiles`, plus a geojson.io URL to view it (`geojsonUrl`, or `geojsonNote` if the geometry cannot be drawn). See [Visualizing service areas](#visualizing-service-areas-geojson).

---

#### `camara_get_area`

Fetches the full details of a single service area by UUID.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `areaId` | string (UUID) | Yes | UUID of the service area. |
| `response_format` | `markdown` \| `json` | No | Output format. Default: `markdown`. |

**Errors**: `404` Area not found.

---

#### `camara_pick_location` (temporarily disabled)

> **Disabled:** this tool is not registered while `ENABLE_MAP_PICKER = False`
> in `server.py`. Use the GeoJSON URLs returned by the area tools instead
> (see [Visualizing service areas](#visualizing-service-areas-geojson)).

Opens an interactive map (see [Interactive Map Picker](#interactive-map-picker-mcp-apps-temporarily-disabled)
below) so the user can point at a location instead of typing coordinates.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `latitude` | number | No | Initial map center latitude. Omit to fit all areas. |
| `longitude` | number | No | Initial map center longitude. Omit to fit all areas. |
| `zoom` | integer (0-22) | No | Initial map zoom level. Omit to fit all areas. |
| `byNetworkProfileId` | string (UUID) | No | Only show areas supporting this network profile. |
| `byQosProfileName` | string | No | Only show areas supporting this QoS profile name. |

Returns JSON with `areas`, a computed `bounds` bounding box, `tileUrl`, and
`center`/`zoom` (only echoed back if the caller passed them). The chosen
location and `serviceAreaId` arrive later as a follow-up user message once
the user confirms a selection on the map, this tool does not return them
directly.

---

## Visualizing service areas (GeoJSON)

Every time a service area is returned, the server also generates a
[geojson.io](https://geojson.io) URL that draws it on a map, no local build or
map hosting needed. The GeoJSON is embedded in the URL itself.

| Tool | Where the URL appears |
|---|---|
| `camara_get_area` | Markdown: `GeoJSON map: [View area](…)` line. JSON: `geojsonUrl` field on the area. |
| `camara_retrieve_service_areas` | Markdown: one link per area, plus an "All areas on one map" link when there are several. JSON: `geojsonUrl` on each area, plus a top-level `geojsonUrl` showing **all** returned areas together. |
| `camara_pick_location` (when enabled) | JSON: `geojsonUrl` on each area, plus a top-level `geojsonUrl` for all of them. |

Notes:
- GeoJSON has no circle type, so `CIRCLE` areas are approximated by a 64-point polygon.
- Areas with missing or malformed geometry get no URL. Instead they carry a
  `geojsonNote` field (JSON) or an "unavailable" line (Markdown), so the absence
  is always explicit.
- Areas with many vertices produce long URLs (the whole GeoJSON is in the link):
  roughly 12,700 characters for a 500-vertex polygon.

### Making sure the link reaches the user

The server attaches the link to every area it returns, but the assistant still
has to relay it. To make that reliable, the rule is stated in three places:

1. **Server instructions**, sent to the host when the connection is
   initialised, so they apply to every tool and prompt.
2. **Tool descriptions** of `camara_retrieve_service_areas`, `camara_get_area`
   and `camara_pick_location`.
3. **Workflow prompts** `dedicated_network_workflow` and
   `discover_profiles_and_areas`.

The rule: whenever an area is shown to the user, include its GeoJSON link, copied
in full and unmodified, unless that exact link was given in the immediately
preceding message. Instructions can only guide the assistant, not force it, so
this is a strong nudge rather than a hard guarantee.

The wording lives in one place, `GEOJSON_LINK_RULE` in `camara/geo.py`.

## Recommended workflow

### Pre-conditions (operator side)

Before calling the API, the following should already be in place:
- The API invoker has signed up with the API provider.
- QoS Profiles, Network Profiles, and Service Areas have been defined by the operator.

### Phase 1: Before using the network

| Step | Tool | What to do |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1.1a | `camara_list_profiles` | Discover available profiles; save the `id` that fits your requirements. |
| 1.1b | `camara_retrieve_service_areas` | Find a service area covering your location; save its `id`. |
| 1.2 | `camara_create_network` | Reserve a network with `profileId`, `serviceAreaId`, and `serviceTime`. |
| 1.3 | `camara_get_network` | Monitor status: `REQUESTED → RESERVED → ACTIVATED`. |
| 1.4 | `camara_create_access` | Grant a device access using the returned `networkId`. |

### Phase 2: During operation

| Step | Tool | What to do |
|------|------|-----------|
| 2.1 | `camara_get_network` | Confirm status is `ACTIVATED`. |
| 2.2 | `camara_add_devices_to_access` / `camara_remove_devices_from_access` | Add or remove devices dynamically (or `camara_create_access` / `camara_delete_access` for an API that takes one device per access). |
| 2.3 | `camara_get_access` | Check device access status: `REQUESTED → GRANTED / REJECTED`. |

### Phase 3: Dismantling

| Step | Tool | What to do |
|------|------|-----------|
| 3.1 | `camara_delete_access` | Revoke each device access. |
| 3.2 | `camara_delete_network` | Cancel the network reservation. |

> **Tip:** The server also exposes four **prompts** for interactive guidance:
> `dedicated_network_workflow`, `discover_profiles_and_areas`, `manage_device_access`, `teardown_network`.

## Interactive Map Picker (MCP Apps): temporarily disabled

> **Status:** disabled because the map does not yet work as required. The code
> (`camara/ui.py`, `camara/tools/picker.py`, `ui/`) is kept intact. To re-enable
> it, set `ENABLE_MAP_PICKER = True` in `server.py`; the tool count then goes
> from 12 back to 13. Building the view (below) is only needed in that case.

`camara_pick_location` opens an interactive Leaflet map inside the chat (via
the [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/extensions/apps)
extension, `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`) so the user can point at a location
instead of typing coordinates:

1. The map opens showing every available service area, dimmed.
2. Clicking a point calls `camara_retrieve_service_areas` (with `atLocation`)
   and highlights the areas covering it, in a side panel ordered from the
   smallest (most specific) to the largest.
3. An optional "draw a circle" mode (checkbox above the panel) lets the user
   click-and-drag instead, querying with `overlappingArea` rather than
   `atLocation`.
4. Clicking "Usar esta área" sends the chosen coordinates, `serviceAreaId`,
   name, and available profiles back into the conversation, continue from
   there with `camara_list_profiles` and `camara_create_network`.

### Building the view

The map is a small Vite + Leaflet project at `ui/area-picker/`, bundled with
[`vite-plugin-singlefile`](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile)
into one self-contained HTML file (Leaflet and the MCP Apps client SDK
inlined, no CDN). **It must be built before starting the server**, or
`camara_pick_location`'s map resource will fail to read:

```bash
cd ui/area-picker
npm install
npm run build
```

This writes `ui/dist/area_picker.html`, which `camara/ui.py` serves as the
`ui://camara/area-picker` resource. If you don't rebuild after editing
`ui/area-picker/src/`, the server keeps serving the previous build, there's
no watch step wired into `python server.py`.

`ui/dist/` is **not** committed (it's covered by the root `.gitignore`'s
`dist/` rule), it's a regenerated build artifact, and Leaflet + the MCP Apps
SDK bundled in make it a few hundred KB, not worth tracking in git.

### Tile server

Map tiles come from `CAMARA_MAP_TILE_URL` (see
[Environment variables](../README.md#configuration)), an XYZ template like
`https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. Its hostname is the only
external origin the view's Content-Security-Policy allows, tiles load as
`<img>` sources, so it's declared under the resource's `resourceDomains`
(not `connectDomains`).

### Known issue

There's an open upstream issue (`ext-apps` #671) about MCP Apps UIs not
rendering in Claude Desktop for Windows when going through the `mcp-remote`
proxy. If the tool runs but no map appears, try connecting directly instead
of through `mcp-remote` before assuming the view itself is broken.
